        title:"A Dangerous Moment in the Hollywood Economy",
        sub:"The season’s Oscar bait has fared poorly at the box office. That doesn’t bode well for daring low-budget filmmaking.Though many excellent movies were released in theatres in 2022, most of them hardly registered on the Hollywood economic scale. In the current environment, few good movies are likely to make money the old-fashioned way, in theatres; meanwhile, the new-fashioned way of streaming doesn’t seem to reliably channel money to producers and distributors. The practice of streaming movies at home accelerated during the pandemic, and most of the movies that have managed to lure large numbers of viewers back to theatres are big-budget franchise films, big-studio animation, and sequels.",
